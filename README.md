### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

To use this Extension you need an API key to call GPT-3

Check out these steps to run this:

Go to extensions - Head to your browser and go to chrome://extensions (note this will be different if you are using another chromium based browser). Here you will see a list of extensions.
Make sure you enable developer mode on the top right.
Load unpacked extension - We are going to get our extension loaded up in our browser to actually test out! Navigate to the root of your project folder
Let it rip - If all went well you should see your extension in all itâ€™s glory in your list of extensions!
